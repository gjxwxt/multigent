# Current progress

## Completed: IM identity center P0

Commit `9650f924` completed the safe visual grouping slice. The account API exposes only routes the current user may access by project or Agent Worker grant. A bound route remains visible solely so its owner can unbind it; an unbound and inaccessible route is omitted.

Verified locally on 2026-09-08:

- `go test -v ./internal/api -run TestUserIMIdentities_VisibilityRules_ABC`
- `make test`
- `make build`

The VM health endpoint responded successfully, but reports version `dev`; it is not provenance evidence for commit `9650f924`.

## Next: IM instance foundation

Do not widen D6 from `ConnectionID` to a URL comparison. First define and verify an instance association for connections. Only then may a cross-connection route clear the old Bot DM channel and create a direct channel for the receiving Bot.
